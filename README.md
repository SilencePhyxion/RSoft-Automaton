# RSoft-Automaton
Optimisation code that uses RSoft's Python API along with scikit-optimisation. It can take numerous fibre cores and allocates them within a hexagonal grid, while also running beamprop through the terminal and determining the best fitting parameter for a given prior, which alleviates the need to run RSoft through the GUI.
